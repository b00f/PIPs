## What is an PIP?

A Pactus Improvement Proposal, or PIP, is a design document that provides information or
describes a new feature for the Pactus blockchain.
The primary goal of a PIP is to encourage the development team to document ideas before implementation and
invite the community to contribute their thoughts.
This process helps to review ideas and identify potential issues before they can impact the production environment.

## PIP Types

There are types of a PIP:

### Standards Track

Standards Track PIPs propose changes to the Pactus blockchain's protocols,
including improvements to the core protocol, network, or any other standards.

### Informational

Informational PIPs describe Pactus design issues, guidelines, or general information
that is not suitable for the Standards Track.
They may also propose features or ideas for further discussion within the community.

### Process

Process PIPs propose changes to the PIP process itself or suggest improvements to
the decision-making process within the Pactus community.

## PIP Categories

Standards PIPs are categorized into the following layers:

### Core

Core PIPs propose changes to the fundamental aspects of the Pactus protocol.
These changes are critical and require careful consideration due to their potential impact on the entire network.

### Networ

Network PIPs focus on changes related to network communication.
This includes improvements to the peer-to-peer protocol, network topology, and related networking functionalities.

### Interface

Interface PIPs propose changes to the external interfaces of the Pactus protocol, such as APIs.
These changes impact how developers interact with the Pactus blockchain.

Got it. Here is the revised description for "Living" along with the other steps:

- **Draft**: The initial state of a proposal when it is first created and submitted to the PIP repository.
- **Review**: The PIP is being evaluated for feasibility, accuracy, and completeness. Feedback and revisions occur during this stage.
- **Accepted**: The proposal has passed the review process and is formally accepted as a valid proposal.
- **Final**: The proposal has been implemented and is considered complete. No further changes are expected.
- **Living**: The proposal remains open for continuous updates and improvements, typically including documents like PIP-1 that evolve over time.
- **Withdrawn**: The proposal is officially removed from consideration or development by the author.
- **Stagnant**: The proposal is not progressing and is not actively being developed, often due to lack of interest or inactivity.
